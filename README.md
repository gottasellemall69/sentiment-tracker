Simple sentiment tracker to track how people from different political spectrums are feeling at a point in time/ in response to possible questions surveyed of them.
Can upload structured data (.txt, .csv, .json) in the form of chat logs, forum posts... to analyze public discourse.
Potentially can be set up to monitor social media (facebook) groups as well, just to take the temperature.
